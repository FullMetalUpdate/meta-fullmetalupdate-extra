# The NOTIFY variable should be set for containers that implement the notify feature of systemd.
# The FullMetalUpdate client will rollback the container depending on the result of the
# container execution.
# TIMEOUT is a required value when NOTIFY is set to 1. It represents a delay (seconds) for
# which the client will wait and ultimately feedback the server in case the container has
# failed in a way the client did not predict. Set this variable larger than
# TimeoutStartDelay= in the service file.
# AUTOSTART must be set to 1 when NOTIFY is set
NOTIFY = "1"

# Set screenused to 1 if the container uses the screen
